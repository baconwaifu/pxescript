 is not subject to the terms of this license unless it's primary purpose is to expose the functions of this
 program in a different way, or simply execute this program.

 A DERIVATIVE is allowed to remove the "manditory name change" clause if the creator so wishes
 ALTHOUGH the derivative cannot restrict further derivatives' licenses from containing the clause
